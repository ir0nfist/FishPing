# FishPing
World of Warcraft Vanilla FishPing for version 1.12.1

This changes the sound when a fish is on the line to be more easily noticable.  It's taken from FishPing which did the same for later versions of WoW.  All I did was view the MPQ to find the proper location and file name so it would be used with 1.12.1.
So, nothing to this.  It's simply a wav file properly named and with correct directory structure and saves you the trouble of having to do it on your own.

Installation:

Extract to your ROOT World of Warcraft install directory.  NOT in the addons folder.
